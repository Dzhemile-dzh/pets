The Fibresand was riding slower than usual and they raced into a headwind too. This opening event was for 4yos and up which had run in at least two hurdles and which are currently eligible for novice hurdles.\\n \\bSWASHBUCKLE\\p whipped round as the flag fell, but quickly recovered and his rider set out to make plenty of use of this thorough stayer. He faced a stiff challenge from the runner-up and pulled out sufficient in the end. His trainer feels he's quite well handicapped over hurdles.\\n \\bShine Baby Shine\\p, previously 2-2 over C&D on the Flat, was the first of these to come under pressure but responded to hold every chance. The winner is rated 25lb her superior on the level.\\n \\bHaulani\\p, who had blinkers back on, was the last of the three off the bridle but didn't pick up. He probably found this too much of a test of stamina.\\n \\bInvestigation\\p, who had been playing up at the start, refused to go after the winner had stood still in front of him at flagfall. He was deemed by the stewards to have been a runner. [Richard Lowther]\\n \\bQUOTES\\p \\bSwashbuckle\\p wasn't doing a whole lot in front. He was hanging fire a bit, but he was always going to stay. It's difficult to go a right gallop in races like this - Donald McCain, trainer. \\n",
